    On a nippy morning in November at the Manhattan Cruise Terminal, Laura sat serenely with outstretched legs on the marine blue synthetic athletic turf field at Pier 97, just a few blocks away. Her giddy toddler, zipped up in a full winter hoodie, shuffled around her.
    The mother-son duo are regulars at the pier-refashioned park, coming for the greenery and open space. But something less pleasant was also mingling in the air. 
    “You can smell it,” she said, a trace of unease in her voice.
    Wisps of black-tinted smoke were curling up toward the Manhattan skyline. The cause was The Norwegian Breakaway floating in plain sight.
    The 18-deck luxury behemoth, looming above the Hudson River at Pier 88 where it is based, is one of half a dozen cruise ships docking at the Manhattan Cruise Terminal this month, gearing up for its weekly voyage to Bermuda later this afternoon.
    When terminals are unequipped with electric shore power, like the one in Manhattan, cruise ships like The Norwegian Breakaway routinely run their massive diesel engines to power up and keep their onboard systems running. Hence the smelly fumes. But local leaders and residents say these emissions have far-reaching consequences.
    “I worry about my son inhaling all these fumes,” said Laura, who chose not to share her last name out of privacy concerns. “It’s hard to find spaces in New York City where kids can play without worrying about a lot of air pollution. It’s not like we have enclosed backyards.”
    For years, community leaders have argued the resulting emissions ocean liners unavoidably spew come at a steep cost to the environment and public health. Yet the sight of cruise ships and other vessels docking at the piers is so tightly woven in the backdrop that many residents who cycle down the bordering bike path — or stroll down the walking trails in the nearby parks — hardly bat an eye.
    And some, like 58-year-old resident Edward Sudentas, say the city’s air pollution problem isn’t on the waters but in the streets.
    “Reducing the number of cars is most important,” said Sudentas, who was stretching near the walking promenade at Pier 97. “It’s a big ship but there’s only one or two here versus millions of cars.”
    Studies no less show that a single ship can rival the pollution footprint of tens of thousands of vehicles. A single medium-sized cruise ship can consume up to 150 tons of fuel a day, according to one report by the Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union. That’s the equivalent amount of particulate pollution to one million cars. 
    Another report by the Environmental Protection Agency reveals one cruise ship docked for a single day releases as much diesel pollution as 34,400 idling tractor-trailers.
    “That is a staggering number,” said Leslie Murphy, co-chair of the Waterfront, Parks & Environment Committee in Manhattan Community Board 4.
    Murphy, one of the most vocal supporters of shore power, says she and the community board have spent years “engaged in ongoing legal battles and discussions” with the New York City Economic Development Corporation — the public-benefit corporation able to make the electric energy system a reality. 
    Last year, the EDC, which manages the terminal, pledged to build the infrastructure to allow cruise ships to turn off their engines and connect to the grid by 2028. In July, their members unveiled the findings of a technical study that confirmed shore power is feasible for the majority of ships at the Manhattan Cruise Terminal — at an expected price tag of $40 million.
    Since then, however, the EDC has backpedaled on the promised timeline — a move Murphy has described “as willful stalling.”
    “The city’s inaction on this issue is slowly killing us,” she said. “The nation's largest city, with multiple ports of call serving some of the largest fleets in the world, has no plan of action to install shore power. That’s unfortunate.”
    The EDC did not directly respond to questions asking for details about a new plan for the promised shore power system. It also remained tightlipped on whether air quality monitoring has been conducted at the terminal to gain a clearer picture of the toll cruise ship pollution exacts on the surrounding neighborhood.
    Resident Ruthie Davis, 23, is all in for “electric-powered ships,” saying that the risk to public health is real.  
    “Whenever you’re burning fuel, the public health risk is partly from the CO2 but also from other fumes like NOX,” she said. By being more energy-efficient, “we in New York City have the ability to change how we do freight and transportation to clean up the pollution.”
    Cruise ship pollution combined with the sheer volume of vehicles on the road continues to plague the community district. Fumes from idling vehicles are the top source of 311 service complaints, according to a two-year analysis. However, cruise ships, unlike buses or trucks, are not classified as idling vehicles under city regulations.

    And yet the two are often closely linked. As The Norwegian Breakaway rested, it triggered a logistical blitz of fuel tankers, tractor-trailers, utility trucks, and tour buses— restocking supplies, performing maintenance, and shuttling cargo and thousands of passengers to and from the ship. The scene also brought a heavy lineup of vehicles snaking along 12th Avenue, many idling with engines humming.
    “We are seeing these long lines of tractor-trailers that have goods and service for the cruise ships as they are coming in,” said Murphy. “A lot of times, these vehicles are idling for hours and hours on end. We’re hoping to attack this as part of our transportation plan for the shore power installation.”
